# XpaTJson

XpaTJson is the demo / utility component of the XpaDemo project which is about "Magic & Json". 
Much there's not yet. A first / initial version v0.1 has been added to XpaDemo v.0.7

Magic Xpa does not really offer any support for Json and the options to add some by only using Magic (like by file and string handling) are limited. Most of the methods in XpatJson will therefore requite you to have below products installed, in enviromnments where you want to use this component.
